# **TODO List for CryptobotAI**  

This file outlines the tasks and improvements to be implemented in the CryptobotAI project.  

---

## **1. Separate Agents into Three Files**  
- **Task**: Refactor the codebase to separate the agents into three distinct files:  
  - `agent-data_analyst.py`: Handles data collection and analysis.  
  - `agent-trading.py`: Executes trading decisions based on analyzed data.  
  - `agent-risk_management.py`: Manages risk and makes decisions to hold, sell, or buy.  

---

## **2. Data Analyst Agent Responsibilities**  
- **Task**: The `agent-data_analyst.py` must:  
  - Collect and analyze market data.  
  - Pass analyzed data to the `agent-trading.py` for decision-making.  
  - Gather crypto market overview data, including:  
    - Fear and Greed Index.  
    - Bitcoin Dominance.  
    - Best-performing cryptocurrencies over the last 90 days with a histogram of performance.  

---

## **3. Clear Workflow for Trading and Risk Management**  
- **Task**: Define a clear workflow for trading decision-making and risk management:  
  - **Trading Workflow**:  
    - Use parameters and logic to determine buy/sell/hold decisions.  
    - Maintain an "order state of mind" based on market conditions.  
  - **Risk Management Workflow**:  
    - Evaluate risk parameters to decide whether to hold, sell, or buy.  
    - Ensure logic is consistent and well-documented.  

---

## **4. Backtesting Enhancements**  
- **Task**: Improve the backtesting functionality to:  
  - Allow backtesting with multiple configuration files.  
  - Run backtests sequentially or in parallel.  
  - Compare results to identify the most effective configuration.  
  - Highlight the most relevant parameters for decision-making.  

---

## **5. Multi-Pair Trading Support**  
- **Task**: Add support for trading multiple cryptocurrency pairs:  
  - **Configuration Files**:  
    - Add predefined configuration files for different crypto pair lists:  
      - `top10.json`: Top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap.  
      - `top25.json`: Top 25 cryptocurrencies by market cap.  
      - `top50.json`: Top 50 cryptocurrencies by market cap.  
      - `top100.json`: Top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap.  
      - `default.json`: BTC/USDT only (default configuration).  
  - **Market Scanner**:  
    - Implement a market scanner to analyze multiple pairs simultaneously.  
    - Add parallel processing for faster multi-pair analysis.  
  - **Priority/Weighting System**:  
    - Add a priority/weighting system for pair selection based on performance and risk.  
  - **Risk Management**:  
    - Implement cross-pair risk management to balance exposure across multiple pairs.  

---

## **6. Automated Config Optimization**  
- **Task**: Add an automated configuration optimization module:  
  - **Backtesting Optimization**:  
    - Support testing multiple configurations:  
      - Different threshold combinations.  
      - Various volatility multipliers.  
      - Position sizing strategies.  
  - **Performance Metrics**:  
    - Implement performance metrics for evaluation:  
      - Sharpe ratio.  
      - Maximum drawdown.  
      - Win rate.  
      - Risk-adjusted returns.  
  - **Configuration Generation**:  
    - Generate configurations dynamically based on market conditions.  
  - **Optimization Reports**:  
    - Create detailed optimization reports highlighting the best configurations.  
  - **Quiet/Mute Mode**:  
    - Add a quiet/mute mode for batch testing to reduce output noise.  

---

## **7. Configuration**  

### **Environment Variables**  
- **Task**: Create a `.env` file with the following variables:  
  ```env
  # AI Provider Configuration
  AI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
  AI_MODEL=mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct
  AI_API_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
  AI_PROVIDER=openrouter  # Options: openrouter, openai, anthropic, etc.
  ```  

---

## **8. Documentation Updates**  
- **Task**: Update the `README.md` and other documentation to reflect the new changes:  
  - Add details about the new agent structure.  
  - Explain the updated workflow for trading and risk management.  
  - Include instructions for running enhanced backtesting and multi-pair trading.  

---

## **9. Testing and Validation**  
- **Task**: Ensure all new features are thoroughly tested:  
  - Validate data collection and analysis in `agent-data_analyst.py`.  
  - Test trading decisions in `agent-trading.py`.  
  - Verify risk management logic in `agent-risk_management.py`.  
  - Confirm backtesting enhancements work as expected.  
  - Test multi-pair trading and configuration optimization modules.  

---

## **10. Future Enhancements (Optional)**  
- **Task**: Consider additional features for future updates:  
  - Integration with more exchanges.  
  - Support for additional cryptocurrencies.  
  - Advanced machine learning models for improved decision-making.  
  - Real-time alerts and notifications for trading activities.
